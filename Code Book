CODE BOOK

This CODE BOOK needs to identify the meaning of the variables in the tidydata dataframe. 
The variables considered are the following with their mean() and std() values:

tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

where "t"" stays for the time values whereas the "f" corresponds to the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
